==================

Expansion on j2kun and lukaszkrawczyk's Python code from the post ["Computing Homology"](http://jeremykun.com/2013/04/10/computing-homology/).

Boundary matrices are automatically computed based on inputting the biggest simplices of the simplicial complex, which are then used to compute the homologies.
